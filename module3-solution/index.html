			Chicken
		</div>
		<p><em>
		Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.

The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.

Mutton curry (also referred to as kosha mangsho, lamb curry, or goat curry,Indonesian: kari kambing or gulai kambing) is an Indian curry dish that is prepared from mutton (or sometimes goat meat) and vegetables. Although very popular in northern India, mainly in Bengal region, the dish is found in different variations across all states, countries and regions of South Asia. It originated from Eastern India, inspired from its counterparts as Fish and Crab curry from Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Railway mutton curry is a variation of the dish that originated during the British India.

Mutton curry was originally prepared heated by a fire in a large pot. It may now be cooked using pressure cookers and slow cookers.Mutton curry may be served with rice or with Indian breads, such as naan or parotta. The dish has been served with raji, a cereal.	</p>

Eggs are, typically from a chicken, cooked with their shells unbroken, usually by immersion in boiling water. Hard-boiled eggs are cooked so that the egg white and egg yolk both solidify, while soft-boiled eggs may leave the yolk, and sometimes the white, at least partially liquid and raw. Boiled eggs are a popular breakfast food around the world.

Besides a boiling water immersion, there are a few different methods to make boiled eggs. Eggs can also be cooked below the boiling temperature, i.e. coddling, or they can be steamed. The egg timer was named for commonly being used to time the boiling of eggs.		</p>
